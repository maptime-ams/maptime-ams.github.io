# Time flies when you're making maps

__Join us Wednesday May 20th for the last edition of Maptime Amsterdam before we go on our summer break. Please sign up via Maptime's [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/220184224/).__

Time flies when you're making maps. Last November, Waag Society's [Maptime chapter](http://maptime-ams.github.io) started with a introduction meeting on digital mapmaking - six months and six meetups later, we've covered a wide range of subjects. We learned about [cartograms and geometric algorithms](https://www.waag.org/en/blog/cartograms-and-one-dimensional-maps), made [hand-drawn one-dimensional maps](https://github.com/maptime-ams/one-dimensional-maps), we designed maps with [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/), Henk van Houtum tought us what he means with [cartopolitics](https://compasstocartopolitics.wordpress.com/) and Hans van der Meer showed why you can immediately tell that you've crossed the [Dutch-Belgian border](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/document-nederland-2014). And during one of the last meetups, we used our Fablab's [laser cutter](http://fablab.waag.org/machine/laser-cutter), OpenStreetMap data and open source geospatial software to make [physical visualizations of street patterns](http://maptime-ams.github.io/street-patterns/).

Wednesday May 20th, it's time for the [last edition of Maptime](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/220184224/) before the summer (but we'll be back in September). Join us at 18:30, the night starts with a walk around the neighbourhood guided by Cees Holtkamp. He's famous for his confectionery and [cookie recipes](http://www.patisserieholtkamp.nl/nl-NL/bakadviezen-en-recepten/), but he knows everything about the history of Amsterdam, too.

Back in the Waag, Huib Morel and Hubert Kraaijvanger of the former [Actiegroep Nieuwmarkt](http://www.npo.nl/andere-tijden/24-03-2015/VPWON_1236042) will show slides and photos from their archives, and tell about how the neighbourhood changed between 1970 and 1980, the years around the construction of the subway line.

After the slide show, we will design and create a print map of how the neighbourhood looked just before the subway was built. By using old photos, slides and OpenStreetMap data, we will export, modify and style this data with [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (or Adobe Illustrator), and we will learn about map design best-practices.

Programme:

- 18:30 - Maptime starts in the Waag
- 18:45 - Start of guided walking tour
- 19:45 - Back in the Waag for slide show from the archives of Actiegroep Nieuwmarkt
- 20:15 - Workshop map design

__Please note: both the walking tour and the slide show will be in Dutch.__
